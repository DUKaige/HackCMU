# HackCMU
This app is developed by a group of 4 within 24 hours in the annual HackCMU Contest.
The following is the intro to the app:
It is a warm Sunday morning. You log onto your facebook page, when you suddenly notice that some of your friends become zombies and start to bite people!
 
However, a brilliant scientist like you never gives up. You have 3 powerful weapons: medicine, vaccine and insulation room. Medicine cures zombies, vaccine protects your healthy friends, and insulation room separates zombies from others. Fully equipped, you begin your adventure to save your friends!

In our demo, we display healthy people as white nodes, disease-carriers as grey, and zombies as green. An edge is connected between friends. Disease-carriers can either turn into zombies or be cured. They can bite people, but zombies are much more destructive! Time and weapons are limited.

At the end of each round, you get 3 coins for each healthy friend, and 1 for each sick friend. You can go to the store and purchase items or update your weapons. However, peace doesn’t last long, and your second adventure is more challenging, with more complicated network, faster speed, and more powerful zombies! There are more rounds afterwards, but we only show 2 in the demo.

The usage of facebook friend network is a highlight of our game. So you should definitely invite your friends to play it! If you have a facebook friend who has downloaded the game, his or her photo will replace the nodes and appear on your screen! The more friends, the more fun!

Now, go and save your “walking friends”!
